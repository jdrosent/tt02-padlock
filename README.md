Press the green button in the top left of the simulation pane. 

Set your desired code using Switches 3 to 5. Once you've done so, toggle Switch 8 to on then back off--the safe is now set!

Turn on Switch 2, and press the push button. The red LED labeled "Locked" should turn on and the seven segment display should show "L" (for locked).

Next turn off Switch 2 to begin entering codes.
